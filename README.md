**PROTIP** Be sure to read [Migrating from 3.x to 4.x](https://github.com/expressjs/express/wiki/Migrating-from-3.x-to-4.x) as well as [New features in 4.x](https://github.com/expressjs/express/wiki/New-features-in-4.x).

## Quick Start

  The quickest way to get started with express is to utilize the executable [`express(1)`](https://github.com/expressjs/generator) to generate an application as shown below:

  Install the executable. The executable's major version will match Express's:

```console
$ npm install -g express-generator@4
```

  Create the app:

```console
$ express /tmp/foo && cd /tmp/foo
```

  Install dependencies:

```console
$ npm install
```

  Start the server:

```console
$ npm start
```

  View the website at: http://localhost:3000

## Philosophy

  The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making
  it a great solution for single page applications, websites, hybrids, or public
  HTTP APIs.

  Express does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. With support for over
  14 template engines via [Consolidate.js](https://github.com/tj/consolidate.js),
  you can quickly craft your perfect framework.

## Examples

  To view the examples, clone the Express repo and install the dependencies:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/expressjs/express.git --depth 1
$ cd express
$ npm install
```

  Then run whichever example you want:

```console
$ node examples/content-negotiation
```
